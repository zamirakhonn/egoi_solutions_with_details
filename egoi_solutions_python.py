# Afruza's Starting Point(Home): 0-th point, which is her home
# Mall's Location(X)
# Moving Time: Afruza can move one point(either left or right) in one second

# Task: Afruza needs to go from her house (0-th point) to the mall(X-th point) and then come back home.

#to solve this problem, we need to calculate the minumum amount of time Malike needs to reach floor(n)
#consider both the elevator and stairs 

#n - the destination floor(where Malika wants to go)
#m - the current floor where the elevator is located 
#t1 - the time it takes for the elevator to move one floor up or one floor down
#t2 - the time it takes for Malika to move one floor using stairs

# first, the elevator needs to come to Malika's floor from m to 1.
# The time taken is abs(m-1)*t1

# then, the elevator will take Malika from floor 1 to floor n. 
# The time taken for this is abs(n-1)*t1
# total elevator time = abs(m-1)*t1+abs(n-1)*t1
# the time is taken is simply abs(n-1)*t2

#Input values 
n, m, t1, t2 = map(int, input().split())

#Time using the elevator 
elevator_time = abs(m-1) * t1 + abs(n-1) * t1 

#Time using the stairs
stairs_time = abs(n-1) *t2

#Output the mininum time
print(min(elevator_time, stairs_time))

# 1)parse the input 
# 2)for each statement, check if it is a power of 2
# 3)if it is, calculate the power(exponent).
# 4)track the maximum power
# 5)output the maximum power
